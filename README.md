## 📈 5-Year Growth Outlook & Financial Impact

VELA is built for sustainability. To help investors, contributors, and partners understand how the token could grow over time, we’ve modeled a realistic 5-year scenario based on crypto sector trends and adoption curves.

### 🧮 Assumptions:

| Metric                        | Value |
|------------------------------|-------|
| Starting price               | $0.01 per VELA |
| Avg. growth (CAGR)           | ~35% annually |
| Year 5 estimated price       | ~$0.45 per VELA |
| Bear year(s)                 | 1–2 years flat/downtrend |
| Staking APY (estimated)      | 10% annual compounded |

---

### 💸 Example: Small Investor (Buys $100 of VELA at Launch)

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| VELA purchased       | 10,000 tokens |
| Year 5 price (est.)  | $0.45 per VELA |
| Value (no staking)   | $4,500 |
| **With staking (10%)** | **~16,100 VELA → $7,250** |

✅ Small investors benefit significantly from staking, and can multiply their value over time while also helping govern the protocol.

---

### 🌊 Ocean Cleanup Fund Deployment

- **Allocation**: 40,000,000 VELA
- **Estimated usage over 5 years**: 70%
- **VELA distributed**: ~28,000,000
- **Avg. market value during distribution**: ~$0.25
- **Total impact funding**:  
  `28,000,000 × $0.25 = $7 million` toward ocean clean-up efforts

---

### 🔒 Founder Vesting Plan (5-Year Timeline)

| Year | Vested Tokens | Cumulative Value (@ $0.45) |
|------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| 1    | 1,000,000     | $450,000 |
| 2    | 1,500,000     | $1.125M |
| 3    | 2,000,000     | $2.025M |
| 4    | 2,500,000     | $3.15M |
| 5    | 3,000,000     | $4.5M (fully vested) |

This ensures founder alignment with long-term community growth.
